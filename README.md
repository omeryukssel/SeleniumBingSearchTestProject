This project is a simple automation test that uses Selenium WebDriver to search for "Selenium Java" on the Bing search engine and prints the titles of the first 5 search results to the console. It serves as a basic example of using Selenium and JUnit 5 for web automation.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç Automatically searches for **"Selenium Java"** on the Bing search engine.
- üìÉ Retrieves and prints the titles of the **first 5 search results** to the console.
- üõ†Ô∏è Simulates browser interactions using **Selenium WebDriver**.
- ‚úÖ Organizes and manages test scenarios with **JUnit 5**.
- üì¶ Easily manages project dependencies using **Maven**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or later ([Java Download Link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html))
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Automatically managed through project dependencies.
- **ChromeDriver**: WebDriver for the Google Chrome browser. ([ChromeDriver Download Link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)) After downloading, you need to add the ChromeDriver to your system's PATH or place it in the project directory.
- **JUnit 5**: Automatically managed through project dependencies.
- **Apache Maven**: For managing project dependencies and running tests ([Maven Download Link](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/your-project-name.git](https://github.com/yourusername/your-project-name.git)
    cd your-project-name
    ```

    **(Note:** Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/your-project-name.git` with your actual GitHub project URL.)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project directory and use Maven to download the dependencies:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **ChromeDriver Setup:**

    - Download the ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version from the [ChromeDriver Download Link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
    - Add the downloaded `chromedriver` executable to your system's PATH environment variable or copy it to the root directory of your project.

4.  **Run the Tests:**

    Use the following Maven command to execute the tests:

    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

    This command will run the JUnit tests, perform the search on Bing, and print the first 5 results to the console.

## üß™ Test Steps

When the project is executed, the following steps are performed automatically:

1.  Opens the Google Chrome browser and navigates to the Bing homepage (`https://www.bing.com/`).
2.  Locates the search input field.
3.  Enters the text **"Selenium Java"** into the search field.
4.  Initiates the search by pressing the Enter key.
5.  Finds the titles of the first 5 search results on the search results page.
6.  Prints the found titles to the terminal (console).
7.  Closes the browser window.
